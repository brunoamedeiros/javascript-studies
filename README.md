# Javascript PDI Studies

> Improving skills involves revisiting some fundamental aspects of Javascript.

## [Enumerability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)

- Create an object myObject with two properties: prop1 and prop2. Make prop1 enumerable and prop2 non-enumerable. Write a function printProperties(obj) that prints all enumerable properties of an object.

- Write a program that reads a string of text and counts the frequency of each word in the text. Make sure that the word count object you create is not enumerable, but the individual word counts are enumerable.

## [Generator Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/GeneratorFunction)

- Write a generator function range(start, end) that yields all integers between start and end, inclusive. Use it to print all even numbers between 1 and 10.

- Write a generator function fibonacci() that yields the Fibonacci sequence. Use it to print the first 10 numbers of the sequence.

## [Meta programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming)

- Write a function addLogging(obj) that takes an object obj and adds a logging functionality to all of its methods. The logging function should print the name of the method and its arguments whenever the method is called.

- Create a proxy for an array that automatically sorts its elements in ascending order whenever an element is added to it.
